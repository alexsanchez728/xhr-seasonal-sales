# NSS Exercise: Seasonal Sales

### Project Description
1. Given two JSON files, one with a list of products and the other with category attributes, load both files via XHRs and store the contents in two different JavaScript variables in your code.
2. Build a web page that lists all of the products, the name of the department it's in and the price
3. Put a <select> element at the top of the page that contains all possible values of the season_discount key in the categories file.
4. As soon as you select one of the seasons, all prices on the page should immediately be discounted by the corresponding percentage. 

### Final Result
A simple product page that displays:
* The product's name
* The product's image
* The product's regular price
* The department it's located in
* And, when selected, the product's discounted price
